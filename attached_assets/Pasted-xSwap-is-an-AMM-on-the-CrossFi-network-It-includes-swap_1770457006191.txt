xSwap is an AMM on the CrossFi network. It includes swap, liquidity pools, staking, token sale, and a veToken voting mechanism that controls how incentives are distributed. My goal was to design a product UX/UI where beginners don’t get stuck on “how do I even swap on a new network?”, while advanced users can open the Route view and see (and trust) how well the system optimizes it.
Context & product challenges
DeFi UX is high-stakes: one mistake costs money, and confusing mechanics quickly turn into distrust. So the key goals were:
Reduce transaction errors, like changing inputs mid-swap, leaving the form during approval, running out of gas, and other “classic” crypto pitfalls.
Keep it transparent for advanced users while still being friendly to beginners (when you’re new to DeFi, you want helpful hints everywhere).
Lower the entry barrier: without XFI you can’t pay gas and send a transaction, and people often leave to “figure it out” and never come back.
Support marketing without breaking UX: make token sale conversion-friendly through numbers and clear logic.
User flows (and other diagrams I use as medicine)
To prevent mistakes, I first map every place where things can go wrong and attach the relevant states and errors.
Then we align the mechanics with the Solidity and frontend teams. I also did a few “marker on a whiteboard” drafts — staking/locking logic, entity relationships, and a bit of token sale.
After that, I built interactive prototypes and ran quick A/B checks inside the team and with a few users. Based on the feedback, I iterated on copy, hints, and structure to reduce confusion on the critical steps.
Feature decisions
Swap
Swap is one of the core flows: users come here to exchange one token for another. I followed the standard pattern to keep it familiar: Max button, token-field switch, wallet balance, and USD value.
On the right, there’s a small action block:
Settings: slippage presets + custom slippage input
Help (?): a short “how this swap works” walkthrough with concrete steps
Faucet: claim XFI (the network’s native token). We explain why XFI is needed and how claiming works.
The built-in Faucet removes a major drop-off point: users don’t leave the product to hunt for gas, and can complete their first swap faster.
After the form is filled, we show the important details: rate, price impact (with warnings when it’s too high), network cost, etc. For advanced users, there’s Route — it shows which tokens and pools the swap goes through. You can copy pool or token contract addresses, and we explain route optimization and gas cost, e.g.:
“Best price route costs ~$6.97 in gas… considers split routes, multiple hops, and the gas cost of each step.”
This makes the product feel transparent: you can see how it works and why the numbers look the way they do.
Pools
I split Pools into two clear modes:
My positions — active positions + quick actions
All pools — a browsing table for comparison (TVL/APY/volume)
Rewards claiming is aggregated — not per position — so it’s simpler and faster.
Add / Remove liquidity
Adding liquidity is a multi-step flow with wallet confirmations. I added step-by-step guidance and a progress stepper so users always know where they are. While a step is running, buttons and inputs are disabled to prevent accidental mistakes.
Token Sale
Token Sale has to sell the platform token (SWA) and help users make a decision quickly. The first thing is choosing the correct network — that’s why it’s highlighted as the most important requirement. Then it’s about timing: the screen shows the countdown timer, stage conditions, and the current vs next price.
To boost motivation, I added an interactive profit estimator. It’s pre-filled by default, can be edited, and is synced with the main purchase form — so when users change the amount, they instantly see an estimated outcome (e.g., projected profit in 3 months).
I also added beginner-friendly video guides to reduce the entry barrier and support load.
Lock + Voting
This was the most challenging part to design: there aren’t many good references, and the logic introduces new concepts like veSWA, voting power, and incentives. The mechanic is simple once it’s explained: when users lock SWA, they receive veSWA as voting power. With veSWA they vote for pools, which affects how incentives are distributed and ultimately impacts yields.
I split the experience into Lock (locks, durations, unlock) and Voting (votes and their impact), and surfaced the key metrics directly in the UI: veSWA amount, rewards, and unlock date, plus helpful hints and empty states.
Outcome
In one month, I designed the product, handed it off to frontend, and coordinated implementation quality. The result is a clean, understandable AMM interface with extra “goodies” for power users and a lot of guidance for beginners.
We also shipped a Vietnamese version and launched for the Vietnamese market (and yes — I had to design it as a separate UI set, because “it will break anyway” is a very real argument in startup life).

Vietnamese version (why it lives in Figma? because “it’s going to break, let’s just redraw it” — said the client and the frontend team). Also: some UI library components.
