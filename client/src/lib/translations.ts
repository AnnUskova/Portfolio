• Keep it transparent for advanced users while still being friendly to beginners (when you’re new to DeFi, you want helpful hints everywhere).
• Lower the entry barrier: without XFI you can’t pay gas and send a transaction, and people often leave to “figure it out” and never come back.
• Support marketing without breaking UX: make token sale conversion-friendly through numbers and clear logic.`

          text: `Swap
Swap is one of the core flows: users come here to exchange one token for another. I followed the standard pattern to keep it familiar: Max button, token-field switch, wallet balance, and USD value.
On the right, there’s a small action block: Settings (slippage presets + custom slippage input), Help (?) walkthrough, and Faucet to claim XFI (the network’s native token).
The built-in Faucet removes a major drop-off point: users don’t leave the product to hunt for gas, and can complete their first swap faster.
After the form is filled, we show the important details: rate, price impact (with warnings when it’s too high), network cost, etc. For advanced users, there’s Route — it shows which tokens and pools the swap goes through. You can copy pool or token contract addresses, and we explain route optimization and gas cost, e.g.:
“Best price route costs ~$6.97 in gas… considers split routes, multiple hops, and the gas cost of each step.”
This makes the product feel transparent: you can see how it works and why the numbers look the way they do.

Pools
I split Pools into two clear modes:
My positions — active positions + quick actions
All pools — a browsing table for comparison (TVL/APY/volume)
Rewards claiming is aggregated — not per position — so it’s simpler and faster.

Add / Remove liquidity
Adding liquidity is a multi-step flow with wallet confirmations. I added step-by-step guidance and a progress stepper so users always know where they are. While a step is running, buttons and inputs are disabled to prevent accidental mistakes.

Token Sale
Token Sale has to sell the platform token (SWA) and help users make a decision quickly. The first thing is choosing the correct network — that’s why it’s highlighted as the most important requirement. Then it’s about timing: the screen shows the countdown timer, stage conditions, and the current vs next price.
To boost motivation, I added an interactive profit estimator. It’s pre-filled by default, can be edited, and is synced with the main purchase form — so when users change the amount, they instantly see an estimated outcome (e.g., projected profit in 3 months).
I also added beginner-friendly video guides to reduce the entry barrier and support load.

Lock + Voting
This was the most challenging part to design: there aren’t many good references, and the logic introduces new concepts like veSWA, voting power, and incentives. The mechanic is simple once it’s explained: when users lock SWA, they receive veSWA as voting power. With veSWA they vote for pools, which affects how incentives are distributed and ultimately impacts yields.
I split the experience into Lock (locks, durations, unlock) and Voting (votes and their impact), and surfaced the key metrics directly in the UI: veSWA amount, rewards, and unlock date, plus helpful hints and empty states.`

Свап — один из ключевых флоу. Я придерживалась стандартного паттерна для привычности: кнопка Max, переключатель токенов, баланс и USD-эквивалент.

Встроенный Faucet убирает точку отсева — пользователям не нужно искать газ на стороне, они могут совершить первый свап быстрее.

Pools
Разделила на «Мои позиции» и «Все пулы». Сбор наград агрегирован — это проще и быстрее.

Add / Remove liquidity
Добавила пошаговое руководство и прогресс-бар, чтобы пользователь всегда понимал статус транзакции. На время выполнения шага кнопки и инпуты блокируются.

Token Sale
Добавила интерактивный калькулятор доходности, синхронизированный с формой покупки, чтобы повысить мотивацию. Также добавила обучающие видео для новичков.

Lock + Voting
Самая сложная часть: разделила опыт на Lock (стейкинг) и Voting (голосование), вынесла ключевые метрики (veSWA, награды, дата разлока) прямо в интерфейс.`
